This is where performances are edited.  A performance is a set of up to eight
voices that can be played together.  You can create layered, split and multiple
channel performances with the TX81Z.

<h3>A Note About Opening The Editor</h3>

When the editor opens, it sends remote controls commands to switch the unit to
performance mode.  This causes the unit to send a bulk dump of the performance
edit buffer and possibly the voice edit buffer.  The program receives these
and updates the snapshot, and by extension the editor.  If the controls flash
and change to different values when you open the editor, this is what is
happening.  This flashing happens when the snapshot file is out of sync with
the unit.  The performance editor initially opens with its controls set to the
data in the snapshot, then when it receives a dump and updates the snapshot,
it will adjust the controls to reflect this.
