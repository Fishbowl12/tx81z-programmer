<h2>Program Change Table Editor</h2>

Back in the early days of MIDI, there were no bank change messages, so program
changes were limited to 128 possibilities.  The TX81Z can hold 184 patches: 
five banks of 32 voices and one bank of 24 performances.  Thus the need for
the program change table to map out which patch should be activated when the
unit receives a particular program change message.

<p>

The program change table editor is pretty simple.  The program change numbers
are on the left and the memory numbers are the right.  The patch names are
only there to make it easy for you to see which patch each memory number is
pointing to - only the memory numbers are stored in the table.

<p>

To set a program change number to activate a particular patch, select the
program change number in the left window, select the patch you want to
associate it with in the right window and click the <i>Set</i> button.

<p>

You can set multiple program change numbers at once.  This works like copying
multiple items from a library to the snapshot: the same number of items need
to be selected in both for the <i>Set</i> button to become enabled.  The
indicators above the two lists will tell you how many items are selected in
them.  See <a href="listboxes.html">list boxes</a> for information on the
different methods that can be used to select multiple items in a list box.
