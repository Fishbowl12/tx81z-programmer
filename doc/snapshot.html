<h2>The Snapshot</h2>

The snapshot is a copy of the voices, performances, and other data that
is currently set up in your TX81Z.  The snapshot was designed to stay
synchronized with the unit.  When you receive data from the TX81Z, the data
always goes into the snapshot, and, conversely, when you transmit data, it
always goes from the snapshot into the unit.

<p>

You can save and load snapshots to files on your computer, you can copy items
from a snapshot to a library, and you can edit the first seven items in
the snapshot (see <a href="editable_items.html">Editable Items</a> for more
on that).  The snapshot is basically your interface to the TX81Z within the
TX81Z Programmer.

<p>

One thing you can't do with snapshots is rearrange the items within them.  You
have to copy the items to a library first with one of the
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html#addtolib"><i>Add To Lib</i></a> buttons and then copy them back into the
snapshot where you want them with the
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html#copyitemsfromlib"><i>Copy Items From Lib</i></a>
button.
