<h2>Edit Buffers</h2>

When you change patches on the TX81Z, the unit doesn't really "go" directly
to a patch in memory.  It fetches the patch from a memory bank and copies it
to its internal edit buffer.  This is how you can edit a patch on the unit
without modifying the memory bank.  You have to explicitly store the edit
buffer to modify the bank.

<p>

The program keeps track of the edit buffers by treating them as separate items
from the items in a bank.  The voice edit buffer is called the VCED and the
performance edit buffer is called the PCED in the sysex part of the TX81Z
manual, so these are the labels I used to represent their types in the 
snapshot.

<p>

Voice edits always affect the VCED item in the snapshot, and performance edits
always affect the PCED item.  It's not possible to edit a bank or library item
in-place, it has to be copied to one of the edit buffers first.  The other
items, like the program change table and the system setup, don't have edit
buffers, so they are edited in-place.
