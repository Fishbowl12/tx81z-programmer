<h2>Amplitude Modulation Controls</h2>

<p>

The amplitude modulation controls determine how much the LFO changes the
amplitude of the affected operators, which can be used for tremolo or wah type
of effects.

<h3>Sensitivity</h3>

This is a factor that affects the overall depth of amplitude modulation.  It's
kind of like a multiplier that increases the effects of the other four sliders.

<h3>OP Enable</h3>

These buttons determine which operators the amplitude modulation affects.  If
the button is depressed, then the operator with that number is affected.
Amplitude modulation will produce a tremolo effect on carrier operators and a
wah effect on modulator operators.  

<h3>AMD</h3>

This determines the base depth of the amplitude modulation.  If this is
increased, the sound will always have amplitude modulation, regardless of the
mod wheel, foot controller, and breath controller.

<h3>MW, FC, BC</h3>

These settings determine the range of the increase in amplitude modulation by
the mod wheel, foot controller, and breath controller respectively.  The
increase is added to the value of the AMD setting, so for example, if the AMD
is set to 50 and the MW is set to 50, and you turn up the mod wheel halfway,
the resulting depth will be 75.

<p>

The BC setting can also affect aftertouch if the unit is set up to use it.
See the <a href="system_editor.html#atbc">AT -> BC</a> setting in the section
on <a href="system_editor.html">system setup</a>.
