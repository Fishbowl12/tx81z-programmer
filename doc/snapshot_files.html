<h2>Snapshot Files</h2>

A snapshot file is just series of TX81Z bulk dumps stuck end to end in the
file, so they should be compatible with any ordinary sysex manager program.

<p>

When the program loads a snapshot file, it scans the dumps for sysex headers
and looks at these to figure out what type of dump it is.  It then loads the
dump in the corresponding slot in the snapshot.  This means that it doesn't
matter what program created the sysex file, nor does it matter what order the
dumps appear in the file.  The program creating the file only needs to write
ordinary TX81Z bulk dumps to the file in order to be loaded directly into the
snapshot of the TX81Z Programmer.

<p>

When you are creating a snapshot to be saved to a file, it doesn't need to
contain a complete set of dumps.  You can create a snapshot of just one bank
of voices if you want.

<p>

If you have a file with multiple dumps of the same type, only the first one
will be loaded, since the snapshot only has room for one.  The only exception
is with the voice banks.  Since there are five of them, it will load up to five
voice banks into the snapshot.  The first one will go into bank I, and second
one will go into bank A, the third bank B, etc.  The program doesn't try to
figure out which banks are preset banks or anything, it just loads them into
the slots.  You can't transmit the voices in the present slots to the unit,
anyway.  They are just there so you can manipulate them.  If there are more
than five voice banks in the file, the rest will be ignored.
