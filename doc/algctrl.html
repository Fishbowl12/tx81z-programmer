<h2>Algorithm Control</h2>

<p>

This control is for selecting the algorithm in the voice editor.  It's pretty
simple, you just use the scroll bar to set the value.

<p>

You can also use the six editing keys on the keyboard (Insert, Delete, Home,
End, Page Up and Page Down) to set the value (see <a
href="keyboard_navigation.html">Keyboard Navigation</a>).

<p>

You can also set the value by typing the algorithm number 1 through 8.

<p>

The control has to have the <a href="glossary.html#focus">keyboard focus</a>
(the scroll bar has to be blinking) in order to use the keyboard on it.
