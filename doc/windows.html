<h2>Windows</h2>

There are many different types of windows in Windows, but I'd like to talk a
little about basic application windows, or frame windows, or whatever you want
to call them.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Program Icon And System Menu</h3>

Clicking on this brings up what they call a system menu, which contains a few
commands for controlling the window.  It looks like this:

<p>

<p>

Pressing Alt-Space will also bring up this menu, as well as right-clicking on
the title bar, or right-clicking on the window's task bar button.

<p>

Restore, Minimize, Maximize and Close are the same as the buttons which are
discussed below.  Notice that the Close item is highlighted in bold typeface.
This means that when you double-click the program icon, it will close the
window (well, that's what the bold is supposed to mean, but the bolding of
the items is not very consistent throughout Windows).

<p>

Move will move the mouse pointer to the title bar, where you can drag it to
move it.  Dragging the title bar of a window will move it anyway, so it's kind
of a waste of time to use the system menu for that, but what the Move command
gives you is the ability to move a window using the cursor keys on the keyboard.
You can press Alt-Space and then M, then pressing the arrow keys will move the
window around.  Pressing enter will stop the moving operation, and pressing
escape will cancel it and put the window back where it was.  This keyboard
moving can be handy sometimes if one of your windows falls off the screen
somehow.  If you are ever in a situation where you can see a window when it's
maximized, but it disappears when you restore it, then this is what has
happened.

<p>

Size is like Move, but it sizes the window instead.  The command will put the
mouse pointer in the center of the window.  You can click and drag at that
point and when the pointer reaches the edge of the window it will begin sizing
it.  Kind of strange, but that's what it does.  You can also the keyboard to
size it, similar to the Move command.

<p>

<h3>Title Bar</h3>

This is referring to the blue bar at the top of the window that contains the
name of the program.  This is typically what you use to move the window around
the screen.  Just click and drag it.  This won't work if the window is
maximized, though, because it already fills the screen.

<p>

Right-clicking on the title bar will bring up the system menu.

<p>

Double-clicking on the title bar will maximize the window if it is restored and
will restore it if it is maximized.

<p>

<h3>Minimize Button</h3>

<p>

"Minimize" isn't really a good name for this function, but what it does is
hide the window.  To get it back, click on its icon on the task bar.

<p>

<h3>Maximize And Restore Buttons</h3>

The maximize button makes the window fill the screen (except for the task bar).
The button will become a Restore button, which is used to return the window
to the size that it was.

<p>

<h3>Close Button</h3>

<p>

This closes the window.  Typically, if the window is the last window open in a
program, then it will exit the program.  In the TX81Z Programmer, if you close
the main window, then it will close all of the windows in the program and exit
the program.

<p>

<h3>Menu Bar</h3>

This gray band under the title bar is called the menu bar.  This holds one or
more menus of commands that the program can perform.  See
<a href="menus.html">Menus</a> for more about menus.

<p>

<h3>Window Border</h3>

The window border is used to resize a resizeable window (not all windows can be
resized--it depends on how the programmer set it up).  You can click and drag
on any of the four edges or corners to resize.  The edges and corners work a
little differently from each other, but they can all be dragged to change the
resize of the window.

<p>

<h3>Client Area</h3>

The part of the window where the action takes place is called the client area.
In the picture it's just painted white, but a program can put anything in
there.

<p>

The way a GUI program is conventionally made, the client area is the
programmer's responsibility and the rest of the elements of the window are the
responsibility of the GUI system, or the window manager, or whatever you want
to call it.  This brings the two big advantages that controls in general have:
(1) it makes the user interface consistent across multiple programs, and (2) it
relieves the programmer from having to write code to deal with the user's
interactions with the window, which is <i>huge</i> time saver.  It's an
incredibly complex job to keep track of the sizes of the windows and the
position of the mouse and which windows overlap which and how the output should
be clipped due to the overlapping and so forth, and as a programmer, I'm glad I
don't have to deal with that.

<p>

GUI systems are truly great innovations in computing, both in terms of their
efficiency and convenience and in terms of their flexibility and possibilities
and my appreciation for them is one of the biggest factors that drove me to
write the TX81Z Programmer.
