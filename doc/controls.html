<h2>Controls</h2>

A control is a component in a GUI program that the user can interact with to
enter data or manipulate the program in some way.  For example, check boxes
and scroll bars are controls.

<p>

Controls benefit both users and programmers.  They benefit users because they
make doing certain things the same across programs, so it makes learning how to
use programs easier.  For instance, a scroll bar works the same way in
Microsoft Word as it does in Internet Explorer.  Controls benefit programmers
because they are already coded up and ready to be used in a program.  The
programmer can basically just drop it in, hook up with a little bit of code and
it will work.  It would be an absolute nightmare if the programmer had to hand
code a control every time he wanted to allow some data entry.

<p>

Windows provides a number of standard controls that programmers can use in
their programs, but programmers can also make their own controls, and I have
created a few for the TX81Z Programmer.  This section describes in detail the
use of the various controls in the editor and the features they have.

<p>

Much of this information is basic Windows information, but surprisingly enough,
there is no description of how to use the standard Windows controls anywhere in
the Windows help file.  They aren't even in the glossary.  It seems that the
only documentation for them exists on MSDN, which is Microsoft's website for
programmers.  Granted, they are pretty intuitive, but they are a lot more
complex than they appear to be and many of them have features that can be
easily overlooked, so I feel obligated to discuss the ones that are used in the
TX81Z Programmer, since they are part of my program and I think programs should
to be documented completely.  Plus, it gives me the opportunity to discuss 
in-depth the modifications I have made to the standard Windows controls as
well as the custom controls that I have made.
