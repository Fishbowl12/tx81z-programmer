<h2>Performance Editor Controls</h2>

<h3>Assign Mode</h3>

<img src="pe_assign.gif">

<p>

The assign mode determines which of the eight possible voices turn on as you
play each note.  The two possible settings are <i>normal</i> and
<i>alternate</i>.  When a key is pressed in normal mode, all of the instruments
sound off that are on the channel of the note-on message.  In alternate mode,
all of the notes assigned to a channel act like a chain, and when a key is
pressed, only one of the notes in the chain is played.  The next key will
play the next note in the chain, and this continues until it circles around.

<p>

For example, say you have a performance set up like this:

<p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Max Notes
    <td>2 <td>2 <td>2 <td>2 <td>0 <td>0 <td>0 <td>0 
  <tr>
    <th>Voice
    <td>I01 <td>I02 <td>I03 <td>I04 <td>* <td>* <td>* <td>* 
  <tr>
    <th>Channel
    <td>1 <td>1 <td>2 <td>2 <td>* <td>* <td>* <td>*
</table>

<p>

In normal mode, if you were you play the notes C-E-G-B on channel 1, then you
would hear voices I01 and I02 for all four notes.  In alternate mode, you would
hear voice I01 for C-E, and I02 for G-B, because there are two notes assigned
to each.

<p>

It's kind of a strange feature, but you can do some nifty things with it.

<h3>Effect Select</h3>

<img src="pe_effect.gif">

<p>

This is where you select the effect you want to use for the performance.  These
effects are described in the <a href="effects_editor.html">Effects Editor</a>
section.  Unfortunately, you can only have one of these effects activated at a
time.

<h3>Microtune Table</h3>

<img src="pe_mttable.gif">

<p>

This is where the microtune table is selected.  Don't ask, I have no idea what
they are or what properties they have &mdash; I just copied the names out of
the manual :-)

<h3>Microtune key</h3>

<img src="pe_mtkey.gif">

<p>

This is where the microtune key is selected.  This only applies to certain
microtuning tables: Pure Major, Pure Minor, Mean Tone, and Pythagorean.  If
this setting doesn't apply to the selected microtuning table, then this control
will have asterisk in it to indicate that it has no effect.

<h3>Instrument Controls</h3>

<img src="pe_inst.gif">

<p>

These controls are where the individual instruments are edited.  An
"instrument" is a voice along with some performance parameters.  The
performance parameters are completely independent of the parameters that are
set in the voice editor.

<h4>Max Notes</h4>

This determines how many notes are assigned to the instrument.  The TX81Z has
a limit of eight note polyphony, so all of the max note settings for all the
instruments of a performance must add up to eight or less.  If you attempt to
assign more notes to an instrument than there are available, the unit will
attempt to rob notes from higher numbered instruments in order to fulfill the
request.  This also means that the <i>Max Notes</i> setting of low numbered
instruments takes precedence over that of higher numbered instruments.  For
instance, if have all 8 notes allotted for instrument 1, then you won't be
able to assign any notes to any of the other instruments until you decrease
the number of notes allotted for instrument 1.

<h4>Voice</h4>

There are two controls for selecting the voice: a menu button and an LCD
control.  Pushing the menu button will bring up a menu of all available voices.
These names come from the snapshot, so if the snapshot isn't fully loaded, then
some or all of the names might be missing.  You can still select the voice and
it will edit the unit just the same.

<p>

The slider does the same thing, but a little more inconveniently.  I originally
had the slider by itself with the voice name statically displayed, but I
swapped the static display with a menu button and I just left the slider in
there.  You can type the voice number into the slider and use the other 
<a href="lcdctrl.html">LCD control</a> features, so it's not entirely
useless.

<h4>Channel</h4>

This sets the MIDI channel for the instrument.  Setting this to <i>omni</i>
will make the instrument respond on all channels.

<h4>Low Limit<br>
High Limit</h4>

This sets the keyboard range in which the instrument will sound.  Useful for
creating split performances.

<h4>Detune</h4>

Detunes the instrument.  It's good for thickening up instruments in layered
performances.

<h4>Note Shift</h4>

Transposes the instrument.

<h4>Volume</h4>

Sets the overall volume of the instrument.

<h4>Out Assign</h4>

Sets the output jack for the instrument.  Either I, II, or both, or if the
TX81Z is exciting you too much, you can turn the output totally off so you can
take a breather.

<h4>LFO Select</h4>

The TX81Z has a limitation of only being able to use 2 different LFOs and a
generic "vib" LFO for all instruments.  The unit will only allow you to use
the first two instruments with note assignments greater than zero for the LFOs.

<h4>Microtune</h4>

In addition to the microtuning table and key settings, each instrument has the
option to use the microtuning settings or not.  This is where you toggle it
off and on for each instrument.

<h4>Instrument Menu Button</h4>

<img src="pe_menubtn.gif">

<p>

The instrument menu button gives you a couple of high level editing operations 
so you can edit multiple instruments.  You can copy one instrument to another
or swap two instruments, which is useful when you want to use the LFO of a
certain voice and you want to move it to slot 1 or 2.  You can also copy an
instrument to multiple instruments.  When this function is selected, you'll see
a dialog box that looks like this:

<p>

<img src="pe_copyinst.gif">

<p>

Just check which instruments you want to copy the settings to and click OK to
copy them.

<p>

Note the rules for max notes always apply, so pay careful attention when using
these functions because it's possible for notes to be robbed from other
instruments.
