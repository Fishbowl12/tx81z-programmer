<h3>Item Types</h3>

A TX81Z setup is composed of different items: voices, performances, the
program change table and other settings.  An item is basically something that
you can edit and copy between files.  Each item has a code associated with it,
so you can see at a glance what the item is.  Here is a list of the type codes
and what they represent:
