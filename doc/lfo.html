The LFO (low frequency oscillator) is used to create cyclical changes in the
sound, like vibrato and tremolo.  This section determines the character of
the LFO, but the LFO won't have any effect until you assign it some depth in
the
<a href="pitchmod.html">pitch modulation</a> or
<a href="ampmod.html">amplitude modulation</a> sections.

<h3>LFO Waveform</h3>

The waveform determines the "shape" of the cyclical change in the sound.  There
are four waveforms: saw up, square, triangle, and sample and hold.  The
triangle wave is the most conventional waveform, and can be used for ordinary
vibrato and tremolo effects.  The other waveforms can be used for interesting
special effects.

<h3>Key Sync</h3>

The LFO can cycle continuously or its waveform can be reset each time you
press a key and this is what the key sync does.

<h3>Speed</h3>

Speed determines the frequency of the LFO.  I don't know the exact formula for
the relationship between the speed setting and the frequency.  From what I
gather the ratio was arbitrarily chosen.

<h3>Delay</h3>

Delay determines how long it takes for the LFO to fade in when you press a key.
