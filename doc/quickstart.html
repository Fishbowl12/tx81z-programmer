<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<ol>
  <li>When you start the program for the first time, it will prompt you to
      configure your MIDI connections to the TX81Z.  The ports need to match
      your cable connections, the transmit channel must match the basic receive
      channel on the TX81Z, and the receive channel must match the transmit
      channel on the TX81Z.  See <a href="mainwnd_menu.html#midisetup">MIDI
      Setup</a> for a more thorough explanation.
<p>
  <li>Go over to the TX81Z unit and configure its MIDI settings on the front
      panel so the editor will work with it.  System exclusive messages 
      absolutely must be turned on and program change messages should be set to
      "com" or "ind".  This is particularly important if you want to store
      patches using the TX81Z Programmer.  Both of these settings are set in
      single utility mode.
<p>
  <li>Next, you'll want to load the TX81Z data into the editor.  In the main
      window, click the
      <a href="snapshot_buttons.html#retrievedata"><i>Retrieve Snapshot
      Data</i></a> button.  When the <i>Select Data</i> dialog box appears,
      click the <i>Check All</i> button and click <i>OK</i>.  The program will
      then request all the bulk dumps the unit is capable of sending and load
      them into the snapshot.  See <a href="snapshot.html">The Snapshot</a>
      for more information about snapshots.
<p>
  <li>Save the snapshot to disk and, for safety's safe, make a backup.  I
      highly recommend doing this, since this is a powerful editor, built
      for convenience, so the tradeoff here is that it can be very easy to
      accidentally wipe out all of your custom patches on the unit if you are
      not careful.  It's a good idea to read through the
      <a href="mainwnd.html">main window</a>,
      <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> and
      <a href="libraries.html">libraries</a> sections of the manual before
      using this program.
<p>
      You'll want to make a file that will always be in sync with the unit, so
      that you don't have to retrieve the data every time you run the program.
      Of course, you don't have to do it this way, but that's how I do it, so
      that's what I'm going to recommend.
<p>
      Click on the disk button at the top of the main window and click
      <a href="snapshot_menu.html#saveas"><i>Save As...</i></a> to save the
      file.  This will be your scratch file.
<p>
      Now click the disk button again and click
      <a href="snapshot_menu.html#savecopy"><i>Save Copy As...</i></a>.  Save
      it under a different name.  This will be your backup in case something
      valuable gets overwritten in the snapshot.
<p>
      To restore a backup use the <a href="snapshot_menu.html#loadcopy"><i>Load
      Copy</i></a> menu item to load the backup into the snapshot, then use
      the <a href="snapshot_buttons.html#retrievedata"><i>Transmit Snapshot
      Data</i></a> button to transmit to the TX81Z.
<p>
  <li>Now you're ready to go in safety.  You can edit a snapshot item by
      clicking on it and clicking the
      <a href="snapshot_buttons.html#edititem"><i>Edit Item</i></a> button.
      You can create libraries of snapshot items by selecting them and
      clicking one of the
      <a href="snapshot_buttons.html#addtolib"><i>Add To Lib</i></a> buttons.
      Read the rest of this manual for details. :-)
