This is a control I whipped up for waveform selection within the voice editor.
I thought using a combo box was kind of cumbersome to use for checking out the
different waveforms so I made something that would keep all of the waveforms
visible so you can just click on the one you want.  The combo boxes are the
default, but you can switch those out the radio panels by selecting 
<a href="ve_menus.html#oneclick">One-Click OP & LFO Wave Type
Selection</a> in the voice editor menu.

<p>

You can also use the number keys on these to select the waveform.
