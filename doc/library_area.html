<a name="librarylists"><h3>Library Lists</h3>

<p>

Each library list is divided into three columns.  The first column is the
<a href="item_types.html">item type</a>, the second column is the item name,
and the third column is the item comment, which can be set with the
<a href="library_buttons.html#recomment"><i>Recomment</i></a> button.

<p>

You'll probably notice that there are two library lists.  I did this solely
for convenience in <a href="library_buttons.html#copy">copying items between
libraries</a>.  They are both identical and have the same functionality.
They work just like regular Windows <a href="listboxes.html">list boxes</a>.

<p>

Double-clicking on a library item will copy that item into
one of the <a href="editable_items.html">editable items</a> of the snapshot,
send the item to the TX81Z, and open the editor for that item.  However, if the
<a href="mainwnd_menu.html#dblclknoopen"><i>Do Not Open Editor When
Double-Clicking Bank Items</i></a> option is turned on, the program will not
open an editor, so you can audition the library items.

<p>

<a name="indicators"><h3>Count And Selected Indicators</h3>

<p>

The count indicators above the library lists tell you how many items are in
the library.

<p>

The selected indicators tell you how many items you have selected so you can
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html#copyitemsfromlib">copy library items into the snapshot</a>.
