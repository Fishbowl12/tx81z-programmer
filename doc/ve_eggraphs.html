<h2>EG Graphs</h2>

<img src="EGgraphs.gif" align="right">

These are graphs of the EG settings.  You cannot edit the EGs with these graphs
- they are solely for giving a general feel for how the EGs will affect the
sound and how they relate to one another timewise. 

<p>

You can click on any of the EG graphs to change the key up position for all of
the graphs.  This doesn't affect the TX81Z at all.  The key up line represents
how long you hold the key down, so it varies with each note played.  The
release rate kicks in when you release the key, so this is how I have depicted
it on the graph.

<p>

The scroll bar over the EG graphs will scroll all of them so you can more or
less see everything.

<p>

You can hide the labels and arcs by checking the
<a href="ve_menus.html#hideeglabels"><i>Hide EG Labels</i></a>
option in the <i>Options</i> menu of the voice editor.
