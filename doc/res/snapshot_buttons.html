<h2>Snapshot Buttons</h2>

<img src="snapshot.gif">

<p>

The push buttons in the snapshot area issue commands to the program that
operate on items in the snapshot.  Sometimes some of the buttons are disabled.
This is because some of them need a certain number of items selected, or the
items need to be a certain type, or both.

<p>

<blockquote>
<table class=note><tr><td class=note>
<h5>Note</h5>
These buttons work on the snapshot items only, not the library items - don't
try to select a library item and click the <i>Edit Item</i> button to edit it,
it won't work!  Double-click the library item to copy it into the snapshot.
Remember, only the first seven snapshot items can be edited.  See
<a href="editable_items.html">Editable Items</a> for a full explanation.
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

<a name="edititem"><h3>Edit Item</h3>

<p>

This will bring up the editor for the selected item.   If the item is a bank
item, then a program change is sent to the TX81Z (which it may or may not
receive - see <a href="system_editor.html">Program Change Switch</a>), and the
item is copied into the one of the edit buffers within the program.  See
<a href="edit_buffers.html">Edit Buffers</a> for more about that.

<p>

If nothing in the snapshot is selected, or more than one snapshot item is
selected, then this button will be disabled.

<p>

<a name="transmitpc"><h3>Transmit Program Change</h3>

<p>

This will just send a program change to the TX81Z that will change it to the
currently selected bank item.

<p>

If a bank item is not selected, then this button will be disabled.

<p>

<a name="addtolib"><h3>Add To Lib 1<br>Add To Lib 2</h3>

<p>

This will copy all of the currently selected items into a library.  If any of
the items already exist in the library, then they are not copied and a window
will pop up to tell you this.  TODO: As of this writing, there is no way to
find out which items are duplicates, though.

<p>

If there are no snapshot items selected, then these buttons will be disabled.

<p>

<a name="bundletolib"><h3>Bundle To Lib 1<br>Bundle To Lib 2</h3>

<p>

These buttons will create performance bundles from the currently selected
performances and add them to a library.  See
<a href="bundles.html">Performance Bundles</a> for more information on bundles.

<p>

If there is nothing selected, or there is anything selected besides
performances, then these buttons will be disabled.

<p>

<a name="copyitemsfromlib"><h3>Copy Items From Lib</h3>

<p>

This button copies items from a library into the snapshot.  It will be disabled
most of time.  To enable the button, you have to fulfill three conditions:

<p>

<ol>
  <li>There must be items selected in both the snapshot and one of the
      libraries.
<p>
  <li>The same number of items must be selected in both.
<p>
  <li>If there is more than one type of item selected, the same number of items
      of each type must be selected in the snapshot and the library.
<p>
      For example, if you want to copy two voices and two performances from
      a library, then you must select exactly two voices and two performances
      in both the snapshot and the library you want to copy them from,
      otherwise the <i>Copy Items From Lib</i> button will remain disabled.
</ol>

<p>

The relative positions of the items are preserved when items are copied.  In
other words, once they are copied into the snapshot, they will be in the same
order as they were in the library.

<p>

VMEMs are voices, and can be copied into the VCED or any of the memory slots
in the user bank (I01..I32).  PMEMs are performances and can be copied into
the PCED or one of the perforance slots (PF01..PF24).

<p>

Note that items are not transmitted to the unit when you copy them into the
snapshot.  You have to transmit them separately with the
<a href="retrieveselected"><i>Transmit Selected Items</i></a> or
<a href="retrievedata"><i>Transmit Snapshot Data</i></a> button.

<p>

<a name="retrieveselected"><h3>Retrieve Selected Items<br>Transmit Selected Items</h3>

<p>

These buttons will retrieve or transmit the items that are selected in the
snapshot from or to the TX81Z unit.

<p>

<blockquote>
<table class=warning><tr><td class=warning>
  <h5>Warning</h5>
  If you use one of these buttons to transfer a bank item, the entire bank
  will be sent or transmitted.  The TX81Z can't receive or transmit one item
  if it's part of a bank, so be careful.
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

<a name="storeitem"><h3>Store Item</h3>

<p>

This button will be disabled unless one of the edit buffers is selected.  This
function stores the edit buffer in the TX81Z, and copies it into the
corresponding position in the snapshot.  When you click this button a dialog
box will pop up to ask you which memory slot you want to store the voice in.

<p>

<img src="storedlg.gif">

<p>

Click the memory number and click <i>OK</i> to store it.  Click <i>Cancel</i>
if you change your mind.

<p>

The FX, PC, MTO, MTF, and SYS can't be stored, since they don't have edit
buffers associated with them (or memory banks, depending on how you want to
look at it).

<blockquote>
<table class=note><tr><td class=note>
<h5>Note</h5>
It's very important that you have the TX81Z configured to accept program
changes.  The storing function needs to send a program change to the unit so
it can store the patch in the right place.
<p>
It's also very important for the program to be able to receive incoming data
from the unit to store patches.  If you have things set up so that you only
have the computer transmitting to the unit and not receiving, then you should
not store patches or performances within the program, but do it from the front
panel.
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

<a name="retrievedata"><h3>Retrieve Snapshot Data<br>Transmit Snapshot Data</h3>

<p>

These two buttons bring up a dialog box to ask you what you want to retrieve
or transmit to the unit.  

<p>

<img src="datadlg.gif">

<p>

Check which items you want to retrieve or transmit.  The <i>Check All</i> and
<i>Clear All</i> buttons check or clear all of the check boxes.  Nothing will
be sent or retrieved until you click <i>OK</i> when some check boxes are
checked.
