<h2>LCD Controls</h2>

<img src="lcdctrl.gif">

<p>

This is a control I made up for the TX81Z Programmer.  It's just a scroll bar 
with a little readout that tells you what value it's set to.  It actually
turned out to be kind of complicated the way it works, but using its
<a href="scrollbars.html">scroll bar</a> ought to be easy enough.  When you
click on an LCD control, the readout will display in inverted colors and the
scroll bar thumb will blink to show it has the input focus.  When you change
the value, it will send a MIDI message to the TX81Z immediately, so you can
hear the results.

<blockquote>
<table class=note><tr><td class=note>
<h5>Note</h5>

You won't always hear the result immediately, even though the parameter value
has been changed in the TX81Z.  This is due to the way the synthesizer works or
even due to quirks in the TX81Z.  Some parameters don't take effect until the
next note-on MIDI message, like the output level of an operator.  Some
parameters don't affect the sound at all because of other parameter settings.
For example, when the decay one level (D1L) of an envelope is set to its
highest setting, 15, then the decay one rate (D1R) will have no effect, because
in this situation the decay level is set to the same level as the attack level
(which is not editable - it's always set to 15), so the once the envelope
reaches the attack level, it is considered to have already decayed to the decay
one level.  Consequently, the decay one rate has no effect.

<h3>Using The Alphanumeric Keys To Set LCD Values</h3>

<p>

You can type the value into an LCD control.  This is where it gets kind of
confusing.  There are actually three different types of LCD controls: numeric
LCDs with scroll bars, text LCDs with no scrollbar, and text LCDs with
scrollbars, which I call "list LCDs". 

<p>

<h3>Numeric LCDs</h3>

<p>

Numeric LCDs can display digit characters and positive and negative signs.
When you first move the focus to the control, it will go into a mode where the
first valid key you type will replace everything in the control.  This is done
so that you can click on it, type a '1', for example, and it will set the
control to 1.  After that first key is typed, it will go into a mode where each
digit you type shifts the digits to the left and the new digit is inserted on
the right.  If it stayed in the previous mode, you wouldn't be able to type in
a two digit number.  But this shifting mode has a problem of its own: to type
in a one digit number in this mode, you have to type in a zero first, unless
the range of the control constricts the shifted value.  For example, if you go
to set the attack rate, the range of it is 0 to 31, so if the current value is
4, and you want to set it to 1, the control will try to shift the 4 over and
add the 1 to it.  But 41 is out of range for the control, so it gets rid of the
4 and sets the control to 1.  If you then wanted to set the control to 2, you
might try to type a 2.  This will set the control to 12, because 12 is a valid
value for the attack rate.  If you tried typing 2 again, it would set the value
to 22.  To set the value to 2 in this situation, you have to type a zero first,
then a 2.

<p>

You can also use the backspace key to remove the rightmost digit from the
LCD (it divides the value by 10 and rounds it down).

<p>

<h3>Text LCDs</h3>

<p>

Text LCDs are used to enter text.  They don't have a scrollbar and they are
just used for entering text.  The voice name is an example of a text LCD.

<p>

<h3>List LCDs</h3>

<p>

List LCDs are kind of an experimental feature.  They are used to select a value
from a list of text strings.  For example, the
<a href="system_editor.html#noteswitch"><i>Note Switch</i></a> in the
system setup editor uses a list LCD and it has three values that you can select
from: "all", "odd", or "even".  List LCDs are very similar to numeric LCDs in
that they both have scrollbars and you can type values into either of them.
But there are differences in the way the keyboard input is handled and it
might be confusing to type into a list LCD when it looks like a numeric LCD.
The simplified frequency selection LCDs look like numeric LCDs, but they are
actually list LCDs because the list of possible frequencies is not contiguous,
so a numeric LCD wouldn't work very well.  The reverb rate LCD is also a list
LCD because of the "off" setting.

<p>

List LCDs do a textual search of the possible values that the LCD can have, so
typing works differently than for the numeric LCDs.  You can set a value by
typing it in, but much of the time you won't have to type in the entire value
string.  For example, in the reverb rate LCD typing the letter O will
immediately set it to 'off'.  It will beep if you try to type an F afterwards,
because no value starts with an F.  For something like the simplified frequency
LCDs, which allow you to set the frequency directly, typing 3 will not set the
control immediately, because there are a few possibilities that begin with 3.
Once you type the first character of a value, there are two possible ways to
proceed.  You can either continue typing the value by typing a period, or you
can step through all of the values that start with 3 by pressing 3 again.  But
the feature turned out to complicate the typing quite a bit (and I might take
that stepping feature out sometime in the future)  For example, in the
simplified frequency selectors for frequency ratios, if you type a 2, and then
type 2 again to match the next value that starts with 2, it will match 22,
and if you continue typing 2 it will only match values that begin with 22.  In
this particular case it's best to use the period to match all of the values
that start with '2.'.

<p>

Note that for list LCDs, every character you type will advance the value by
one, as long as it matches something.  If you reach the value you want you can
press Enter or Escape to finalize the value.

<p>

You can also use the backspace key when you're typing in a value.

<p>

<h3>Using The Editing Keys To Change LCD Values</h3>

<p>

<h4>Numeric LCDs</h4>

<p>

The six editing keys above the arrows can be used the change the values in a
numeric LCD control.  These are used a little differently than in other
programs, as I have redefined them to make it easier to use the keyboard with
LCDs.  Here is a chart of how they are used:

<p>

<img src="editkeys.gif">

<p>

Of the six, the three top keys increase the value and the three bottom keys
decrease the value.

<p>

Insert and Delete change the value by one.  They do the same thing as clicking
on the scroll bar arrow buttons.  Their names make for convenient mnemonics,
where <b>IN</b>sert stands for "<b>IN</b>crement", and <b>DE</b>lete stand for
"<b>DE</b>crement".  Pretty spiffy.

<p>

Home and End set the LCD to its minimum or maximum value respectively. 

<p>

Page Up and Page Down change the value by "a few".  These keys perform the same
function as clicking above or below the scroll bar thumb.  The exact amount
varies from control to control.  Some of them change by a fixed value, and some
of them change by whatever value I thought was most convenient.  For example,
on the <i>Transpose</i> LCD in the voice editor, these keys will change the
setting by one octave (unless changing it by an octave would set the control
out of its minimum or maximum range, in which case it is set as far as it will
go).

<p>

<h4>Text Controls</h4>

The edit keys for text LCD controls work pretty much normally.  Insert toggles
insert and overstrike modes, Delete deletes the character at the current
position, Home moves the cursor all the way to the left, End moves the cursor
all the way to the right, and Page Up and Page Down do nothing since there is
nothing to page.

<p>

<h3>Copying And Swapping LCD Values</h3>

In an effort to make editing multiple parameters easier, I implemented dragging
LCD values from one to the other.  You just click on the little LCD display,
drag it to another LCD and release the button.  This will set the target LCD
to the same value as the source LCD, as long it's within its valid range.  If
the value falls out of its range, it will just set it as close as it can get.

<p>

You can also press shift before you drop it if you want to swap values between
the two.
