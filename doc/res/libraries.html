<h2>Libraries</h2>

A library is a file composed of items that can be
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html#copyitemsfromlib">copied to</a> and
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html#addtolib">from</a> snapshots.
You can <a href="library_menus.html#sortmenu">sort</a> them, <a
href="library_buttons.html#recomment">comment</a> them, and <a
href="library_buttons.html#copy">copy</a> them into other libraries.  A library
is stored on disk with a .tx8 extension.  The file format is specific to the
TX81Z Programmer, but you can <a href="library_menus.html#export">export</a>
library items to regular sysex files en masse if you want.  You can also <a
href="library_menus.html#import">import</a> sysex files into a library.  There
is no limit to how many items you can store in a library, other than 
available memory.
