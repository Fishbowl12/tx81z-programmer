<h2>Mysteries Of The TX81Z</h2>

<ul>
<li>How are the coarse frequency values for the operators calculated?  Are they
stored in a table, or are they calculated on the fly?  
<p>
From what I could gather from trying to figure this out, all the frequencies
are multiples of the frequencies between the 1.00 and 2.00 range: 1.00, 1.41.
1.57, and 1.73.  These are each taken and multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2, 3... up to
15.  They are then sorted and that's basically what you're looking at when you
step through the coarse frequencies for an operator.  They don't follow this
pattern quite exactly, though, and I think this is due to rounding errors in
the unit that can happen when you do limited precision arithmetic.
<p>
<li>How are the fine frequency values calculated? 
<p>
<li>How are the actual frequencies coming out of the unit calculated?
<p>
When I was creating the simplified frequency selection sliders, I wanted to
sort all the frequencies so that the lowest was at the bottom, and the highest
was at the top.  If you've played around with the frequency settings for
awhile, you'll notice that some of them are duplicated when you have different
coarse and fine frequencies set.  Now, I'm very perfectionistic about these
things, and I knew that the frequencies it put out are actually different than
what it showed on the display, so to sort them accurately I wrote a little
utility that would measure the actual frequency coming out of the unit for
every possible set of frequency settings.  When I did that, what happened was
the some of the frequencies are actually higher then frequencies that showed
up as lower in the display!  For example, the display frequency of 1.49 puts
out a slightly higher frequency than the one it puts one at 1.50.  So, this is
why the simplified frequencies are out of order, because I measured the audio
instead of going by the numbers.  I don't know if this phenomenon is particular
to my unit, or a range of frequencies on the unit (I only measured A440), so
it could very well be the wrong way to do it, I don't know.
