<h2>Dialog Boxes</h2>

Dialog boxes aren't considered controls, but it's a term I use quite a bit in
the manual, and this is the best place to talk about it.  A dialog box (or
simply "dialog") is a window with controls in it that is used for data entry.
Here is a simple dialog box from WordPad:

Dialog boxes usually interrupt the normal execution of the program to get some
information from the user.  They almost always have <i>OK</i> and <i>Cancel</i>
buttons, or some other types of buttons that allow you to dismiss the window.

You can usually use the tab key to move the cursor from field to field.  The
position of the cursor among a set of dialog controls is called the <i>input
focus</i> in programming parlance.
