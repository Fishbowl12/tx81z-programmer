<h2>The Snapshot Menu</h2>

<img src=snapshot_menu.gif>

<p>

This menu is used to save and load your snapshots from files.

<p>

<a name="new"><b>New</b> creates an empty snapshot with no file name.

<p>

<a name="open"><b>Open</b> loads a snapshot into the program from a file.

<p>

<a name="save"><b>Save</b> saves the snapshot to the file indicated in the file name
indicator.  If the snapshot has no file name, you will be prompted for one.

<p>

<a name="saveas"><b>Save As...</b> saves the snapshot in a new file.

<p>

<a name="savecopy"><b>Save Copy As...</b> saves the snapshot in a new file,
but doesn't change the name that the current working snapshot is filed under.
This is useful for making backup copies of the snapshot.

<p>

<a name="loadcopy"><b>Load Copy</b> loads a snapshot file into the current
snapshot, but preserves the current file name.  If the snapshot file that
you're loading is incomplete, and you already have a file open, then the items
that the file does contain will be overlaid onto the current snapshot.
