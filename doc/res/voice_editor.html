This is where you edit voice parameters.  Everything you need to edit single
voices is in this window.  Most of the controls will send parameter change
messages to the TX81Z.  You should be able to watch the parameters changing on
the TX81Z front panel as you manipulate the controls in the voice editor - a
nice feature of the TX81Z for editor writers, I might add.
