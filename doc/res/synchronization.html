<h2>Synchronization With The Snapshot While Editing</h2>

When you edit a voice in the voice editor of the program, the program will
apply the edit to the edit buffer in the snapshot and it will send a parameter
change message to the the TX81Z.  In other words, the program will try to keep
two synchronized.

<p>

This process isn't perfect, however, and the two can sometimes fall out of
sync with each other and you'll have to manually synchronize them.

<p>

You can either send the snapshot's edit buffer to the TX81Z, or retrieve the
TX81Z's edit buffer to update the snapshot to get them back into sync.  This
can be done using the Editor menu of the editor you are working in, or with
buttons to the right of the snapshot list in the main window.

<p>

<h2>Automatic Synchronization</h2>

My goal with this program was to try and create a transparent interface to the
unit, but the communication from the TX81Z to the program is very limited, so I
needed to hack around the limitations, and I did this by retrieving dumps and
analyzing them to figure out what state the unit is in.  This was kind of
tricky but I think it works pretty good.  The situations where the data is
retrieved automatically are as follows:

<p>

<ul>
  <li>The program opens the MIDI-In port and leaves it open the whole time the
      program is running.  I did this so that when the TX81Z sends a dump, the
      program will receive it and update the snapshot.  But it won't receive
      every dump spontaneously, only the VCED and the PCED.  I did this for a
      couple of reasons.  For one, if you change patches with the front panel
      of the unit, the TX81Z will send a sysex dump of the current patch.  The
      editor will receive this and use it to update the snapshot.  I did this
      so you'll know what you are editing at all times.  Another reason for the
      spontaneous updates is that certain functions are not available with
      direct sysex commands, so I worked around this with the remote sysex
      commands, which are commands that act like button pushes from the front
      panel.  The complication with this is that the program has to know what
      mode the unit is in in order to send the right series of commands.  The
      only way this can be done is by sending Play/Perform button messages and
      receiving the dumps until the dump of the desired mode is received.
      Fortunately, this won't wipe out the edit buffer if you have made edits
      on it, so it's a perfectly safe thing to do -- on my unit at least.  You
      may want to test yours to be sure.  I know there are
      <a href="tx81z_notes.html#versions">different versions of the TX81Z</a>,
      but I don't know what all of the differences are between them.
<p>
  <li>The program will request the program change table when it needs to do a
      program change.  It does a program change when you select a bank item and
      click the "Transmit Program Change" button, or you double-click on a
      bank item.  That's pretty obvious, but another situation where it
      requests the program change table is when you go to store a voice or
      performance from within the program.  It does this to be sure that the
      right patch is selected before going through with the storage procedure,
      which involves a bunch of remote commands, so it also does the Play
      button jig above, sends a program change, and then sends a bunch of
      button push commands, so it's a pretty involved process.  I haven't had
      any problems with it though, so I think it should be okay.  If you have
      any problems with it, let me know.
<p>
      Another thing about doing program changes is that if the program change
      that it needs to do is not in the table, then it hacks the table in order
      to do the program change.  In other words, it replaces the first entry
      with the entry it needs, sends program change #1, and then changes it
      back.  It's kind of funny, really, but that's the only way to do it when
      the editor needs to do a program change that's not in the table.  
<p>
  <li>The system setup is the only other thing the editor grabs out of the unit.
      It mostly needs this to see if memory protect is turned on, and it needs
      to know this whenever you store a voice or performance, or you send a
      voice bank or performance bank to the unit.
<p>
  <li>There's another situation where the system setup is relevant, but the
      editor doesn't retrieve it automatically, and that's when sending a
      program change while in performance mode.  The "program change switch"
      in the system setup affects this and the editor will conform to the
      behavior of the unit if the system setup is properly synchronized, so
      this is the main reason I added the
      <a href="mainwnd_menu.html#startupsystem">Retrieve System Setup At
      Startup</a> option to the main menu.
</ul>

<p>

So those are all of the synchronization scenarios.  Wasn't that fun?  I don't
think it's really important to remember all that.  As long as you don't treat
the snapshot data like permanent data, then you should be safe from data loss.

<p>

I don't think the system setup and program change are all that important, but
it's possible to lose a voice or performance that you've been working on if
you're not careful.

<p>

The thing is is that it was a design decision I made between convenience and
safety, and I chose convenience.  I think in the long run, when you're
comfortable with the program, that convenience is better.  I probably worry too
much about it, but I really have no idea who will be using this program and
what type of skills people have.  I just don't know.

<p>

What I do know is that I downloaded an editor for my FS1R one time and I
clicked on something before I knew how it worked, and it wiped out all of the
data on my FS1R, 100 voices, 100 performances, many of them programmed from
the front panel, and I had no backup or anything.  I was pretty ticked off
about it and I pretty much quit making music altogether after that, so I don't
want that to happen to anyone.
