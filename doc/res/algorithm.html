<h3>Menu Button</h3>

The label for this section is a button which brings up a menu, and this is
documented in the section on <a href="ve_menubtns.html">Menu Buttons</a>.

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

The algorithm determines the function of each operator in the voice.  Each
numbered box in the diagram represents one operator.  The operators in the
bottom row represent carriers.  A carrier is an operator that produces sound
directly.  Operators above the bottom row are modulators.  A modulator modifies
the sound of the operators it is connected to via frequency modulation (i.e.
FM synthesis).

<h3>Feedback</h3>

The line going around operator 4 represents feedback.  Feedback is the amount
of self-modulation operator 4 has.
