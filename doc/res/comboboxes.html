<h2>Combo Boxes</h2>

The combo box (aka drop-down list box) is a control that allows you to select
an item from many choices.

<p>

The selected item is displayed in the control, and there's a button with a
down arrow on it that displays a menu with all of the available choices.  This
keeps the control compact and from taking up too much screen space.

<p>

<blockquote>
<table class=note><tr><td class=note>
<h5>Note</h5>
Some combo boxes allow you to enter text for the selected item (which,
incidentally, is where the combo box gets its name), but I didn't use any of
those in the program, so I won't be covering them here.
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are two slightly different ways to use the mouse to pick an item.  You
can either click on the combo box and then click on an item in the menu, or you
can press the mouse button down on the combo box, drag the pointer to the item
you want, and release the button.  A combo box is a type of menu, but it is
used for setting an option rather than executing a command.

<p>

You can also use the keyboard to select items.  The up and down arrow keys will
move the current selection up and down through the choices.  You can also 
press the first letter of an item to select that item.  If there is more than
one item with the same first letter, pressing the key repeatedly will step
through all the items that begin with that letter.

<p>

In the TX81Z Programmer, I have modified the combo boxes (as well as many
other controls) to support keyboard navigation with the arrow keys, so the
up and down arrows keys do not work on them.  The functionality of these keys
has been replaced with the Insert and Delete keys (see <a
href="keyboard_navigation.html">Keyboard Navigation</a> for more about
this).
