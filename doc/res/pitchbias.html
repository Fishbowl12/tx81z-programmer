This affects how much the breath controller will bend the overall pitch of
the sound.  Positive values will bend the pitch up and negative values will
bend it down.

This setting can also affect aftertouch if the unit is set up to use it.
See the <a href="system_editor.html#atbc">AT -> BC</a> setting in the section
on <a href="system_editor.html">system setup</a>.
