<h2>Keyboard Navigation In The Editors</h2>

Every editable parameter has its own control, so there are a lot of controls
in the editors.  I've tried a few different ways to make it easier to
manipulate them all and keyboard navigation is one thing I came up with.

<p>

The keyboard is not used like it is in a regular
<a href="dialogs.html">dialog</a> with the tab key switching between the
different controls.  The tab key method is good for filling out forms, like
your name and address, but synthesizer parameters are not normally programmed
in a particular order like a form is, so the tab key doesn't work very well.
I decided that the arrow keys would make the most sense, so that is how I
implemented keyboard navigation.  The problem with doing it that way is that
some of the controls ordinarily use the arrows keys to select values, like
<a href="comboboxes.html">combo boxes</a> and
<a href="scrollbars.html">scroll bars</a>.  So, I rigged up the six editing
keys above them to make up for this.

I've taken the liberty of redefining the meaning of a few keys, which might
make it strange at first, but I think it makes sense tactilely.

<p>

The rules are pretty simple: for the six editing keys, the top three keys
increase the value and the bottom three keys decrease it.

<p>

The arrow keys are the same in that they move the cursor in a certain
direction, the only difference is that they move it from control to control.

<p>

An exception is with text controls, like the voice name, the left and right
arrow keys will move the cursor left and right within the control, but if you
use the right arrow key to move the cursor, it will eventually be moved out of
the control and onto the control to the right.  The left arrow key will return
it to the text control.
