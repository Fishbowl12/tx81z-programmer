<h2>Editable Items</h2>

Out of all the hundreds or even thousands of items that you can manage with
the TX81Z Programmer, only seven of them are directly editable and those are
the first seven items in the snapshot: the VCED, the PCED, the effects
settings, the program change table, the two microtuning tables, and the system
setup.  Each of these items has its own editor window, which you can bring up
by selecting the item in the snapshot list and clicking the "Edit Item"
button.

<p>

Anything else you want to edit has to be copied into one of these seven items
before it can be edited.  This is usually done automatically and it will
replace the current contents of the item with the item you want to edit before
bringing up the editor for that item.  For example, if you have a voice
called "GrandPiano" in the voice edit buffer (see <a href="edit_buffers.html">
Edit Buffers</a>), and you double-click on a patch in a library called "Uprt
Piano" in order to edit it, "GrandPiano" will be erased out of the voice edit
buffer and replaced with "Uprt Piano".

<p>

There are a number of situations in which the contents of an editable item are
replaced:

<p>

<ul>
  <li>When you double-click on a bank voice in the snapshot (that is, the type
      code is a patch number), then the contents of the VCED are replaced with
      the voice you double-clicked on.
  <p>
  <li>When you double-click on a bank performance in the snapshot (that is, the
      type code is a performance number), then the contents of the PCED are
      replaced with the performance you double-clicked on.
  <p>
  <li>When you double-click on a library item that is not a performance bundle,
      that item will replace the editable item in the snapshot that has the
      same type as the double-clicked item.  If it's a performance bundle, it
      <i>could</i> replace the effects or one of the microtuning tables (see
      <a href="bundles.html">Performance Bundles</a> for more information on
      how they are copied into the snapshot).
  <p>
  <li>If you manually change patches on the front panel of the unit, then the
      unit will automatically send a bulk dump of the voice or performance
      that is shown in the display.  The TX81Z Programmer will pick this up
      and update its copy of the voice or performance edit buffer, so as to
      stay synchronized with the unit.
  <p>
  <li>Anything you do in an editor will directly change the edit buffer it is
      associated with.
</ul>

<p>

<h3>A Word Of Warning</h3>

The snapshot was designed to act as a reflection of what is currently stored
in the TX81Z.  It shouldn't be used as a library.  You should always use a
scratch file as the working snapshot, especially if you have the TX81Z
Programmer set up to <a
href="mainwnd_menu.html#autosavesnapshots">automatically save snapshots</a>
when you close the program or open a new snapshot.

<p>

If you want to use snapshots to store different TX81Z setups to use in
different situations, do it with the "Save Copy As..." and "Load Copy" items
in the snapshot menu.  This will prevent the program from saving changes to
your setups that you didn't intend to save.
