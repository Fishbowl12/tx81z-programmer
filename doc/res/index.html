<h3>Thank you for using the TX81Z Programmer!</h3>

I've been wanting to write an editor for my TX81Z for a long time, but I kept
putting it off.  I finally got around to it and this is what I came up with.
The TX81Z Programmer is a complete TX81Z editor and librarian.  Every function
and parameter of the unit is represented.  I wanted to create a powerful
editing environment, so I threw in a lot of extras that I hope are useful to
you.  I tried to make this program fast and easy to use, so you can spend less
time editing and more time making the sounds and music you want to make.  This
mostly came from my personal experience in programming the TX81Z and
programming computers, so it might feel somewhat quirky at first, but once you
get used to it, I think you'll like it.

<p>

<h3>Organization Of This Manual</h3>

First I put a couple of sections on getting started.  I wrote a little
<a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start</a> section, which will hopefully be
enough to get you up and running at least.  Next is a section on how to set up
the editor for use with multiple TX81Z units.

<p>

Next, I organized the manual by window.  There are seven different window types
starting with the <a href="mainwnd.html">main window</a>.  The main window is
kind of like two windows in one, so after a little overview of the two sections
and a discussion of the menus, I added two more topics on the
<a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> and the <a href="libraries.html">library</a>.
<b>I highly recommend reading through the section on the
<a href="mainwnd.html">main window</a> at the very least.</b>  This section
discusses the design of the program and how the data is treated by the program.

<p>

The rest of the windows come sequentially after these sections: the
<a href="voice_editor.html">voice editor</a>, the
<a href="performance_editor.html">performance editor</a>, the
<a href="effects_editor.html">effects editor</a>, the
<a href="pctable_editor.html">program change table editor</a>, the two
<a href="microtunings_editors.html">microtuning table editors</a>, and
the <a href="system_editor.html">system setup editor</a>.

<p>

After these I threw in a couple of references, one on the
<a href="controls.html">controls</a> used in the program, a little
<a href="glossary.html">glossary</a> of terms, and a section of
<a href="tx81z_notes.html">TX81Z notes</a>, which contains some of the
obscurities of the TX81Z.
