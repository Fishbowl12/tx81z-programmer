<h2>Snapshot Area</h2>

<h3>Snapshot List Box</h3>

The main feature of the snapshot area is the list in the center.  Everything
that can be manipulated in the TX81Z shows up in the snapshot list.  The list
is divided into two columns within the list box.  The column on the left is
the <a href="item_types.html">item type</a>, and the column on the right is
the item name.

<p>

The snapshot list box is an ordinary Windows list box.  The only modification
to it is with the drawing of it, but that doesn't affect the functionality at
all.  For a discussion of how list boxes work see
<a href="listboxes.html">List Boxes</a>.

<p>

Actions are performed on individual items by selecting them and pushing one of
the buttons to the left or right of the list (see
<a href="snapshot_buttons.html">Snapshot Buttons</a>), or by double clicking
on them.

<p>

<a name=doubleclicking><h3>Double-Clicking Items</h3>

Double-clicking on an item will generally open the editor for that item, but
there are exceptions for the bank and library items that I'd like to discuss.

<p>

When you double-click on a bank or library item, the program copies the
selected item to an edit buffer first.  This is because all edits occur only
on the snapshot's edit buffer as opposed to edits affecting bank or library
items directly, as discussed in the section on
<a href="edit_buffers.html">Edit Buffers</a>.

<p>

The program will also try to synchronize the unit with what is in the snapshot
edit buffer.  This happens in one of two ways:

<p>

<ul>
<li>If you double-click on a library item, like a VMEM (voice) or a PMEM 
(performance), the program will not only copy that item into one of the
editable seven items in the snapshot, it will also transmit that item to the
TX81Z's edit buffer.
<p>
<li>If you double-click on a bank item in the snapshot, the program will skip
sending the entire voice and just send a program change to change the unit to
the patch number you double-clicked.
</ul>

<p>

You can also configure double-clicking on a bank item to
send a program change without opening an editor.  This makes it faster to
audition the patches in the unit.  This is done by going into the <a
href="mainwnd_menu.html#optionsmenu"><i>Options</i> menu</a> and checking <a
href="mainwnd_menu.html#dblclknoopen"><i>Do Not Open Editor When
Double-Clicking Bank Items</i></a>.

<p>

Note that sometimes you can load a snapshot from a file that doesn't match the
bank loaded on the TX81Z.  The program has no way to know when this happens
and you'll just have to re-synch the two.

<h3>The Selected Indicator</h3>

Just above the list and to the right is a readout that tells you how many
items are selected in the list.  This is useful when copying items from a
library into the snapshot because the same number of items need to be selected
in each in order to copy them (see the <a
href="snapshot_buttons.html#copyitemsfromlib"><i>Copy Items From Lib</i></a>
button).

<p>

<h3>The File Name Indicator</h3>

The gray text field at the top of the window tells you the file name of
the snapshot you have open.

<p>

If you're working on a snapshot from scratch, the indicator will be blank.

<p>

If the snapshot has been modified but not saved, this will be colored red (or
whatever color you have chosen as the highlight color; see <a
href="mainwnd_menu.html#setcolor"><i>Set Highlight Color...</i></a> for more).

<p>

You can configure the indicator to display the full path to the file by going
into the <i>Options</i> menu and checking
<a href="mainwnd_menu.html#showpaths"><i>Show Full Path Names</i></a>.
