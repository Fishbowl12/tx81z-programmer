<h2>Library Menus</h2>

<p>

<a name="filemenu"><h3>Library File Menu</h3>

<p>

<img src="library_file_menu.gif">

<p>

<a name="new"><b>New</b> creates an empty library with no file name.

<p>

<a name="open"><b>Open</b> loads a library into the program from a file.

<p>

<a name="save"><b>Save</b> saves the library to the file indicated in the file name
indicator.  If the library has no file name, you will be prompted for one.

<p>

<a name="saveas"><b>Save As...</b> saves the library in a new file.

<p>

<a name="import">
<b>Import</b> imports items from a file into the library.  Selecting this menu
item brings up the <i>Import File</i> dialog box.

<p>

<p>

Importing actually does a heuristic search for data that could conceivably be
a voice or a performance by checking the range of each byte in a potential
match to see if they all fall within valid ranges.  This allows you to import
patches from any file whatsoever.  Here are some of the voice patches that
exist in Microsoft Excel:

<p>

<p>

But seriously, I created this feature because I had some old disks from a V50
that I wanted to recover the patches from, but the disks couldn't be read by
DOS, even though they were IBM compatible disks.  So, I used a disk utility to
create some raw disk images, which is like having the entire disk in one file,
and I used this import function to search the file and recover the patches.
It worked pretty good, so I kept it in here.

<p>

You can search for voices, performances, or both.  Performances are kind of
useless if you don't know which patches go with them, and that information is
lost when importing, but it's conceivable that you could figure it out by
looking at the patch numbers and judging by the order of the voices that were
imported.  I didn't implement any help for this task because that's way beyond
the scope of this program and I didn't think it would be that useful, anyway.

<p>

<i>Do Not Import Duplicates</i> is like the
<a href="mainwnd_menu.html#disallowdupes"><i>Disallow Duplicates</i></a> menu
item.  It will prevent importing duplicate patches, even if they have the same
name.

<p>

<i>Make Duplicate Names Unique</i> will put a number in patch names that are
the same and increment it so the names of the imported patches are all unique.
Two patches that have the same name can still have different parameter
settings, so even if you disallow duplicates, some of the imported patches can
still have the same name.

<p>

<i>Check Every Byte Position For A Match</i> will start the search at the next
byte after finding an item.  Normally when an item is found using the heuristic,
the search will begin at the byte following the match, but when this is checked
it will starting searching from the second byte of the match.  This will
increase the number of patches found, but there will likely be a lot of overlap.

<p>

<a name="export">
<b>Export</b> exports voices or performances from a library into one or more
files.  The items are exported into banks with 32 items each.  The <i>Export
File</i> dialog box will be displayed when you select this command.

<p>

<img src="exportdlg.gif">

<p>

If you have more than a bank's worth of items, then this window will pop up
multiple times and prompt you for a file name for each export batch (however
many banks it takes to export all of the items).  If the last batch doesn't
contain a full bank of items, the program will fill it out with init voices or
init performances.

<p>

Check the <i>Selected Only</i> option to export only the items that are
selected in the library.

<p>

Check <i>Write Sysex Headers</i> to add a sysex header and footer to the file
instead of writing just the raw data (chances are, you'll want this on).

<p>

<i>Append To File</i> will allow you to concatenate multiple batches into one
file.  Just check it and select an existent file and it will add the batch to
the end of it.

<p>

<a name="sortmenu"><h3>Library Sort Menu</h3>

<p>

<img src="library_sort_menu.gif">

<p>

This ought to be pretty self-explanatory.  These items give you different ways
to sort the items in the library.

<p>

<b>Sort By Order Added</b> sorts by the order the items were added to the
library.

<p>

<b>Sort By Type</b> sorts the list by type.

<p>

<b>Sort By Name</b> sorts alphabetically by name.

<p>

<b>Sort By Comment</b> sort alphabetically by comment.  If you want to organize
your patches by date so you can sort them, it might be a good idea to use a
format like YYYY-MM-DD so that the alphabetical sort will sort them by date.

<p>

<b>Sort By Selection</b> will move all of the selected items to the top of the
list.

<p>

<b>Sort By Search...</b> will bring up the search dialog.

<p>

<img src="searchdlg.gif">

<p>

Enter the text you want to search for, check the fields you want to search
and it will move all the matching items to the top of the list.  The search
is case insensitive.  It's kind of slow if the library is big, but just be
patient.
