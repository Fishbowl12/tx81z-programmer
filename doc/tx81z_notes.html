<h2>TX81Z Notes</h2>

<p>

<a name="greeting"><h3>Changing The Greeting Message</h3>

You can use the <a href="system_editor.html">system setup editor</a> to change
the greeting message that appears when you power up the units, but you can also
change it on the unit itself by following these steps.

<p>

<ul>
  <li>If your TX81Z is turned on, turn it off.
<p>
  <li>Press the STORE button and keep it pressed as you power on the TX81Z.
<p>
  <li>The TX81Z will display a screen that looks like this:<p>
<img src="editgreet.gif">
<p>
The bottom line contains the startup message and you will see the cursor
blinking at the beginning of the line.
<p>
  <li>The procedure for editing the message is the same as editing the name of
a voice or performance: the CURSOR keys will move the cursor from left to
right and the DEC/INC buttons will change the character under the cursor.
<p>
  <li>Press the PLAY button to exit the message editing mode.
</ul>

<p>

<a name="version"><h3>Finding The TX81Z Firmware Version Number</h3>

You can find the version number and date of your TX81Z's firmware by following
these steps:

<p>

<ul>
  <li>If your TX81Z is turned on, turn it off.
<p>
  <li>Press both MASTER VOLUME buttons and keep them pressed as you power on
      the TX81Z.
<p>
  <li>The TX81Z will display a screen with the firmware version.  This screen
      will only be shown for a couple of seconds.  The screen that mine
      displays looks like this:<p>
<img src="rev1_5.gif">
<p>
  <li>Another screen will appear asking you if you want to test the push
      buttons on the unit.  This screen looks like this:<p>
<img src="testentry.gif">
<p>
<blockquote>
<table class=warning><tr><td class=warning>
  <h5>Warning</h5>
  Going through this button test will perform a "factory reset", which will
  replace all of the user editable data with the data that it shipped with
  from the factory.  I recommend making a full backup of the unit before
  checking the firmware version just in case.
</table>
</blockquote>
      Clicking the INC button will begin the test.  Click the DEC button to
      avoid running the test.  If you run the test, the unit will ask you to
      press each button from left to right to verify that each one is
      functioning.
</ul>

<p>

<a name="versions"><h3>Differences Between TX81Z Versions</h3>

I originally planned on creating a list of differences between TX81Z ROM
versions, but as it turns out, Yamaha issued a series of service bulletins
that already has these changes fully disclosed.  These were kindly sent to me
by Jesse Hager and it can be downloaded from my website at <a
href="http://the-all.org/tx81z/files/TX81Z_Service_News.pdf" target="_blank">http://the-all.org/tx81z/files/TX81Z_Service_News.pdf</a>.
