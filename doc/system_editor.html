<h2>System Setup Editor</h2>

<img src="sysdlg.gif">

<p>

This is where you edit the configuration of the unit.  This is kind of like
where you tell it the context in which it is being used.

<h3>Master Tune</h3>
This is the master tune setting, in units of 64/100 cents.

<h3>Basic Receive Channel</h3>
This is the channel that the TX81Z receives MIDI data on.  This includes the
channel that single mode operates on, as well as all sysex data.  The MIDI out
channel of the editor has to match this channel in order for the editor to
operator on the unit.  If you change this setting, the editor will try to
follow and it will set its MIDI out channel to match it.  This doesn't always
work though, because the channel can be changed in the editor faster than the
unit can react to it, so it's possible to cut off communication with the unit
by changing this setting too quickly.  If this is set to <i>omni</i> then the
unit will react to all MIDI channels.

<h3>Transmit Channel</h3>
This is the channel that the unit sends MIDI data on, like bulk dumps.  The
editor's MIDI in channel must match this channel on the unit to receive bulk
dumps from it.  If you change this setting in the system setup editor, the
editor will follow it and change its MIDI in channel to match it.

<h3>Program Change Switch</h3>
This setting determines how the unit reacts to program changes.  When set to
<i>off</i>, the unit will not be affected by any program changes.  When this
is set to <i>com</i> or <i>ind</i>, then when the unit is in single mode, it
will change to whatever patch is set in the corresponding program change table
entry.  When the unit is in performance mode, these two act a little
differently.  When it's set to <i>com</i>, and the unit is sent a program
change that corresponds to a voice, then the unit will change to single mode
and dial up that voice.  But if this is set to <i>ind</i>, and it receives a
voice program change, then the unit will stay on the same performance, but the
instruments in the performance that are on the channel in which the program
change was sent will be changed to the voice indicated by the program change.

<p>

Let me give you an example.  Say the unit has PF01 dialed up, which is a
performance with eight voices that looks like this:

<p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Channel
    <td>1 <td>1 <td>1 <td>2 <td>2 <td>2 <td>3 <td>3
  <tr>
    <th>Voice
    <td>I01 <td>I02 <td>I03 <td>I04 <td>I05 <td>I06 <td>I07 <td>I08
</table>

<p>

Also, the program change table has A21 in entry 21, and you send program change
21 to the unit on channel 1.  If the program change switch is set to <i>com</i>,
then the unit will switch to single mode and dial up voice A21.  But if the
program change switch is set to <i>ind</i>, then all of the instruments slots
in the performance which are set to channel 1 will change to A21, so the
performance above will look like this:

<p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Channel
    <td>1 <td>1 <td>1 <td>2 <td>2 <td>2 <td>3 <td>3
  <tr>
    <th>Voice
    <td>A21 <td>A21 <td>A21 <td>I04 <td>I05 <td>I06 <td>I07 <td>I08
</table>

<p>

The editor can be used to automatically send program change messages as you
edit the different voices and performances on the unit, which is pretty handy.
This setting is absolutely necessary if you want to store patches in the unit
from the editor because it needs to send a program change message so it can
store the item in the right place.  If you want this to take effect, then you
should set this setting to <i>com</i> or <i>ind</i>.  I highly recommend it.

<a name="noteswitch"><h3>Note Switch</h3>
This is used if you want to use two TX81Zs in conjunction with each other.
You set one of them to <i>even</i> and set the other to <i>odd</i>, load up
both of them with the same patches and set them both to the same MIDI channel,
and they will more or less operate like a single TX81Z with 16 note polyphony
with one unit playing the even numbered notes and the other unit playing the
odd numbered notes ("numbered" referring to the MIDI note number).  I have
never tried this, so I can't say how well it works.

<h3>Pitch Bend Switch<br>
Control Change Switch</h3>
This allows you to set up a single global channel for pitch bend messages or
control change messages, or turn either of these classes of messages off.  This
can be useful if you want these message to affect all of the instruments in a
performance, even if they are on different channels.

<h3>Combine Mode</h3>
Combine mode is a weird little thing that allows you to preserve "function
settings" across multiple voices as you change programs.  The functions it
affects are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Pitch Bend Range
  <li>Portamento Time
  <li>FC Volume
  <li>FC/MW/BC Pitch and Amplitude
  <li>BC Pitch Bias
  <li>BC EG Bias
  <li>Poly/Mono
  <li>Portamento Mode
</ul>
<p>
If you're changing patches on the TX81Z, and no matter what patch you change to,
it looks "edited" (i.e. the "P" in "PLAY SINGLE" is lowercase), then you have
combine mode turned off, and the current set of function settings is being
applied to every voice to change to.  It's an odd little feature, and I have
no idea what it's good for, so I keep it on all the time.

<a name="atbc"><h3>AT -&gt; BC</h3>
This will cause aftertouch messages to act like breath controller messages so
you can use aftertouch with the unit.

<h3>System Exclusive</h3>
This setting allows the unit to be modified by sysex messages.  The editor
needs this turned on to operate on the unit.  If you turn this off here,
communication between the editor and the unit will be cut off, and you'll have
to reactivate it on the unit.

<h3>Memory Protect</h3>
When this is on, the unit won't let you store voices or performances.  None of
the other settings are affected, though.

<h3>Startup Message</h3>

This is the message that is briefly displayed when you turn the unit on.
