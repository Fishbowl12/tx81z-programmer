#TX81Z Programmer

http://the-all.org/tx81z/programmer.html

This is an MS-Windows software editor for the 1987 Yamaha TX81Z synthesizer module.  The TX81Z Programmer was originally released on May 25, 2005.  I originally released it as $20 shareware, but now I've decided to release it as open source under the GNU Public License version 2.

Warning:  This is an out-and-out Win32 program written in C.  No attempt was made to make this easy to port to other systems.

This code was originally written and compiled on Visual C++ 6.  I took the last shareware release, 1.21, removed the licensing code, got it compiling under Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition, and that's about all I did.  There are probably some suboptimal project settings that could be improved upon.

I'm admittedly a bit of a technological minimalist.  This code was built strictly on the Win32 API, so there are no libraries needed to compile and run other than what's included with Visual Studio.
